01 - nothin
02 - unplugged, myserty re-index, plugged in
03 - rated 5 stars on bonobo song "animals"
found the ratings, 11th element in 0x80 groupings, first byte 0x05
that matches with 11th tracks in index

04 - different week, different music, after unplug from work machine it did a mystery reindex
05 - plugged in after #4 mystery re-index, unplugging there also gave a mystery re-index, weird.
06 - plugged in again after #5 mystery re-index, unplugging also gave another re-index
07 - deleted so thoed single from #6
08 - in #7 i notice the song is still there but it's a value changed from 02 to 00, i dunno if my code will parse that correctly
so i am plugging it in after #7's re-index to see how 8 compares, thinking maybe the data will be gone from there now for real
i think some of those initial bytes being set to 0xffffffff says reindex or something (3rd set of 4 bytes)
ok so, the index is removed after re-index
the metadata is updated immediately
and now parse supports detection of pending deletes
also file size doesn't change and meta index seems to stay the same

09 - lookin for unicode file
10 - added first track of tree's album to golist to detect change
